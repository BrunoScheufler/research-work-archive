# Research work archive at [TUM DSE](https://dse.in.tum.de/)

This repository contains reports, theses and final presentations for BSc/MSc
theses, guided research (GR) and interdisciplinary projects (IDP) at [our
chair](https://dse.in.tum.de/). For open topics take a look at [our chair's
website](https://dse.in.tum.de/theses/).

## Submission

Once you are done with your research work at our chair, please submit a pull
request to add your GR/IDP report, your BSc/MSc thesis or your final
presentation to this archive.

We follow a strict naming convention for systematic archival of the documents.
We collect the documents in year- and semester-wise folders, and classify them
by the type (BSc/MSc thesis, GR, IDP).

Steps to add your research work to the archive:

1. Select the appropriate year and semester folder -- __Based on the submission date__
2. Add your final presentation to the `talks` folder
3. Add your final report or your final thesis to the `docs` folder
4. Include your research work in the `README.md` in the year folder

## Format

Please follow this format for your file names:

```
<type>_<lastname>_<title>.pdf
```

where

* `<type>` is either `bsc`, `msc`, `idp` or `gr`
* `<lastname>` is your last name
* `<title>` is the title in lowercase letters and words separated by
  underscores

And you are done, **thank you**!
