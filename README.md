# Research work archive at [TUM DSE](https://dse.in.tum.de/)

This repository contains reports, theses and final presentations for BSc/MSc
theses, guided research (GR) and interdisciplinary projects (IDP) at [our
chair](https://dse.in.tum.de/). For open topics take a look at [our chair's
website](https://dse.in.tum.de/theses/).

## Submission

Once you are done with your research work at our chair, please submit a pull
request to add your GR/IDP report, your BSc/MSc thesis or your final
presentation to this archive.

We follow a strict naming convention for systematic archival of the documents.
We collect the documents in year- and semester-wise folders, and classify them
by the type (BSc/MSc thesis, GR, IDP).

Steps to add your research work to the archive:

1. Select the appropriate year and semester folder -- __Based on the submission date__
2. Add your final presentation to the `talks` folder
3. Add your final report or your final thesis to the `docs` folder
4. Include your research work in the `README.md` in the year folder

## Hints on year and semester folders

If the research work was submitted between 1st of April and the last day of
September, it was a summer semester. Else a winter semester. If the work was
submitted in winter semester, please put it in the year folder belonging to the
start of the winter semester, i.e., if the winter semester is 22/23 please put
it into 2022 (even if the work was submitted in the first three months of
2023). Thanks!

## Format

Please follow this format for your file names:

```
<type>_<lastname>_<title>.pdf
```

where

* `<type>` is either `bsc`, `msc`, `idp` or `gr`
* `<lastname>` is your last name
* `<title>` is the title in lowercase letters and words separated by
  underscores

And you are done, **thank you**!
